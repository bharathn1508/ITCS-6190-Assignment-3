## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end serverless data processing pipeline on AWS. The system automatically ingests raw order data, processes it using Lambda functions, catalogs it with AWS Glue, and provides SQL query capabilities through Amazon Athena. Finally, results are visualized on a live web dashboard hosted on an EC2 instance.

### Architecture Components:
- **Amazon S3**: Data storage with organized folder structure
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless data processing and filtering
- **AWS Glue**: Automated data cataloging and schema detection
- **Amazon Athena**: SQL query engine for S3 data
- **Amazon EC2**: Web server hosting the analytics dashboard
- **IAM**: Security and access management between services

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Approach

### High-Level Workflow:
1. Raw order data (CSV) is uploaded to S3 `raw/` folder
2. S3 trigger automatically invokes Lambda function
3. Lambda processes and filters the data, saving results to `processed/` folder
4. Glue Crawler scans processed data and creates a queryable table schema
5. Athena executes SQL queries on the cataloged data
6. EC2-hosted Flask application displays query results in a web dashboard

## 1️⃣ Amazon S3 Bucket Structure 🪣

### Setup Steps:
1. Created S3 bucket: `aws-orders-pipeline-bharath` in `us-east-1` region
2. Established three-folder architecture:
   - **`raw/`**: Stores incoming raw CSV files (Orders.csv)
   - **`processed/`**: Contains Lambda-filtered data (filtered_Orders.csv)
   - **`enriched/`**: Holds Athena query results

### Purpose:
This structure separates data by processing stage, enabling clear data lineage tracking and preventing accidental overwrites. The organized hierarchy also simplifies IAM permission management and debugging.

## 2️⃣ IAM Roles and Permissions 🔐

Created three IAM roles with principle of least privilege to enable secure service-to-service communication:

### Role 1: Lambda Execution Role
- **Name:** `Lambda-S3-Processing-Role`
- **Purpose:** Allows Lambda to read from S3 and write processed data
- **Attached Policies:**
  - `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` - CloudWatch Logs access
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess` - Read/write S3 permissions

### Role 2: Glue Service Role
- **Name:** `Glue-S3-Crawler-Role`
- **Purpose:** Enables Glue Crawler to scan S3 data and create catalog entries
- **Attached Policies:**
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess` - Access to S3 processed folder
  - `AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess` - Glue console operations
  - `AWSGlueServiceRole` - Core Glue service permissions

### Role 3: EC2 Instance Profile
- **Name:** `EC2-Athena-Dashboard-Role`
- **Purpose:** Grants EC2 instance permission to execute Athena queries and read results
- **Attached Policies:**
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess` - Read query results from S3
  - `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` - Execute and manage Athena queries

## 3️⃣ Lambda Function Creation ⚙️

### Function Configuration:
- **Function Name:** `FilterAndProcessOrders`
- **Runtime:** Python 3.9
- **Execution Role:** `Lambda-S3-Processing-Role`
- **Timeout:** 1 minute (increased from default 3 seconds)

### Lambda Function Logic:
The Lambda function implements business logic to filter order data:

**Filtering Criteria:**
- **Removes** orders with status `pending` or `cancelled` that are older than 30 days
- **Retains** all recent orders (within 30 days) regardless of status
- **Retains** all `shipped` and `confirmed` orders regardless of age

**Processing Flow:**
1. Triggered by S3 event when CSV uploaded to `raw/` folder
2. Reads raw CSV file from S3 using boto3
3. Parses CSV and applies date-based and status-based filters
4. Writes filtered results to `processed/` folder with `filtered_` prefix
5. Logs processing statistics (total records, filtered count, retained count)

**Why This Filtering?**
This removes stale pending/cancelled orders while preserving completed transactions and recent activity, ensuring downstream analytics focus on actionable and relevant data.

## 4️⃣ S3 Trigger Configuration ⚡

### Trigger Setup:
- **Event Source:** S3 bucket `aws-orders-pipeline-bharath`
- **Event Type:** All object create events
- **Prefix:** `raw/` (ensures trigger only fires for files in raw folder)
- **Suffix:** `.csv` (only processes CSV files)

### Why This Configuration?
The prefix and suffix filters prevent infinite loops (Lambda won't trigger on its own output in `processed/`) and ensure only relevant file types are processed. This event-driven architecture eliminates the need for scheduled jobs or manual intervention.

### Testing the Pipeline:
1. Uploaded `Orders.csv` to `s3://aws-orders-pipeline-bharath/raw/`
2. Lambda automatically triggered within seconds
3. Verified `filtered_Orders.csv` appeared in `processed/` folder
4. Checked CloudWatch Logs for processing statistics

## 5️⃣ AWS Glue Crawler Setup 🕸️

### Glue Database:
- **Database Name:** `orders_db`
- **Purpose:** Logical container for table metadata

### Crawler Configuration:
- **Crawler Name:** `orders_processed_crawler`
- **Data Source:** `s3://aws-orders-pipeline-bharath/processed/`
- **IAM Role:** `Glue-S3-Crawler-Role`
- **Target Database:** `orders_db`
- **Schedule:** On-demand (manual execution)

### Crawler Execution:
1. Ran crawler manually from Glue console
2. Crawler scanned processed CSV files in S3
3. Automatically inferred schema (column names and data types)
4. Created table named `processed` in `orders_db` database

### Result:
The Glue Data Catalog now contains a table with the following schema:
- `orderid` - string
- `customerid` - string  
- `orderdate` - string (date format)
- `status` - string
- `amount` - double (numeric)

**Why Glue Crawler?**
Manual schema definition is error-prone and time-consuming. Glue Crawler automates schema discovery, making data immediately queryable in Athena without writing DDL statements.

- **Key Pair:** `athena-dashboard-key.pem`
- **IAM Instance Profile:** `EC2-Athena-Dashboard-Role`

### Security Group Rules:
- **SSH (Port 22):** Restricted to my IP for secure access
- **HTTP (Port 5000):** Open to 0.0.0.0/0 for public web access

### Software Installation:
Connected via SSH and installed required dependencies:
```bash
sudo yum update -y

2. Uses boto3 to execute queries via Athena API
3. Polls for query completion status
4. Fetches results from S3 enriched folder
5. Parses CSV results and renders HTML tables
6. Serves responsive dashboard on port 5000

### Running the Dashboard:
```bash
python3 app.py
```
Accessed via: `http://[EC2-PUBLIC-IP]:5000`

## 🎯 Key Learnings

### Technical Skills Gained:
1. **Serverless Architecture:** Understanding event-driven computing without managing servers
2. **Data Pipeline Design:** Implementing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) patterns in the cloud
3. **IAM Security:** Configuring least-privilege access between AWS services
4. **SQL Analytics:** Writing complex aggregation queries for business intelligence
5. **Full-Stack Integration:** Connecting backend services to frontend visualization

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **Table Name Mismatch:** Glue auto-named the table "processed" instead of expected "filtered_orders" - required updating all queries in Flask app
2. **Lambda Timeout:** Default 3-second timeout was insufficient for processing - increased to 1 minute
3. **Security Group Configuration:** Initially forgot to open port 5000, preventing web access - added custom TCP rule
4. **IAM Role Attachment:** EC2 instance must have IAM role attached at launch; cannot modify after launch without stopping instance

### Best Practices Applied:
- ✅ Organized S3 folder structure for clear data lineage
- ✅ Used IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Implemented event-driven processing (no polling/scheduling)
- ✅ Leveraged serverless services to minimize operational overhead
- ✅ Documented code with comments and logging statements

---

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### Free Tier Usage:
- **S3:** First 5GB storage free (used ~5MB)
- **Lambda:** 1M requests + 400K GB-seconds compute free (used ~5 invocations)
- **Glue:** 1M objects stored + 1M requests free (used 1 crawler run)
- **Athena:** 10GB scanned data free per month (used ~1MB)
- **EC2:** 750 hours t2.micro free per month (used ~2 hours)

**Total Estimated Cost:** $0.00 (within Free Tier limits)

## 🛠️ Resource Cleanup

To avoid future charges, I stopped the EC2 instance after completing the assignment. For complete cleanup:
```bash
# Stop EC2 instance (preserves setup for future demos)
AWS Console → EC2 → Instances → Stop Instance

# Optional: Complete deletion after grading
- Terminate EC2 instance
- Empty and delete S3 bucket
- Delete Lambda function
- Delete Glue crawler and database
- Delete IAM roles
```
